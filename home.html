        <h2>&#8594;&#x1F4D6;Explanation of the game</h2>
        <big>
          <p>
            <dfn>Dota 2</dfn> is played in matches between two teams of five
            players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate
            base on the map&#128506;. Each of the ten players independently
            controls a powerful character, known as a "hero". There are
            currently 122 possible heroes to choose from, each with unique
            abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players
            collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully
            defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A
            team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient",
            a large structure located within their base.
          </p>

        <h2>&#8594;&#128336;History</h2>
        <big>
          <p>
            Originally, <b>Dota</b> was a mod game for the video game Warcraft 3
            that could be played online between players. The actual
            lead-designer &#128056;IceFrog who developed Dota 1 was hired by
            Valve to make a remake of this game. The game later was released for
            Windows, MacOS, and Linux via Steam in July 2013. The game is free
            to play and there is no need to pay for heroes that are available to
            play for everybody. To maintain the game, Dota has a service Dota
            Plus which offers loot boxes and bonuses that are used for
            decoration of the game for the user which does not hurt the actual
            gameplay for the people.

        <h2>&#8594;&#127918;E-Sports</h2>
        <big>
          <p>
            Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world
            playing in various professional leagues and tournaments. Valve
            manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, a series of
            tournaments that award qualification points for earning direct
            invitations to The International, the game's premier annual
            tournament. Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system
            that has seen amounts in upwards of US$40 million, making Dota 2 the
            most lucrative esports game.
          </p>

        <h2>&#8594;&#9733;Popularity</h2>
        <big>
          <p>
            Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and
            overall complexity, Dota 2 was praised for its rewarding gameplay,
            production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, with many
            considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time. It
            has been one of the most played games on Steam since its release,
            with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity
            of the game has led to official merchandise and media adaptations
            for it being produced, including comic books and an anime series, as
            well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media.
